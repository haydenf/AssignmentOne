# Our planning and creating
___
We had 3 main ideas and a few others. First was to do a mad Libs game and the second was to make a hangman game and the third was to make a pomodoro timer. The full game took two days to complete. We had used trello to write down a basic understanding of how we are going to make this app. We started brainstorming ideas quickly that we got from nands talk. We picked up on the Mad-Libs idea and started working on it, we began by making a flow chart and a user story. Through trello Hayden broke the project into a series of features in order to complete the app. Each of us then worked on different features throughout the day and helped each other if needed. We finished most of our features in a day so we had to upload it to GitHub. The following day we continued to work on completing the app and merging all features to work together.
